# Rail Django

Rail Django is a production-ready GraphQL framework for Django, built on top of Graphene-Django. It reduces boilerplate, enforces security best practices, and provides enterprise-grade features out of the box.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Auto-Generation**: GraphQL Types, Queries, and Mutations generated from Django Models.
*   **Performance**: Solves N+1 problems automatically with `select_related`/`prefetch_related` injection.
*   **Security**: Built-in RBAC, Query Depth Limiting, and Input Validation.
*   **Developer Experience**: `auto_camelCase` conversion, CLI scaffolding, and clear configuration.
*   **Enterprise Extensions**: Audit Logging, Webhooks, Exporting, and Observability.
